# ClaraVisio: Computational DeFogging via Image-to-Image Translation on a Free-Floating Fog Dataset

ClaraVisio (or Clara for short; Latin for "clear sight") builds on top of two previous attempts: [StereoFog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02344) by Anton Pollock and [FogEye](https://github.com/Chan-man00/fogeye) by David Moody, Laura Parke, Chandler Welch, with the aim of collecting data and developing a framework for Image-to-Image translation (I2I) of foggy pictures. This project was conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Rajesh Menon](https://faculty.utah.edu/u0676529-Rajesh_Menon/hm/index.hml) at the [Laboratory for Optical Nanotechnologies](https://nanoptics.wordpress.com/) at the University of Utah during the summer of 2024 made possible by the University of Utah Summer Program for Undergraduate Research ([SPUR](https://our.utah.edu/research-scholarship-opportunities/spur/)). This work differs from previous research in using a novel free-floating fog dataset and a transformer-based model.
